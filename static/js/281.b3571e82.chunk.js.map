When I Google “useState array update”, most of the StackOverflow links are already purple. I’m writing a blog post on it and I’m still going to have to look it up later I’m sure.\r\n\r\n        There might be an example buried deep in the React docs somewhere I can reference, but the main idea is that the array of objects (or really any value) should be treated as immutable.\r\n        Which is confusing, because it isn’t actually immutable. You can change\r\n        it as you like. It’s just not “best practice” to do so.\r\n\r\n        Below is a simple React useState array update example. It’s essentially some\r\n        functions that perform the basic CRUD (create read update delete)\r\n        operations on the state array. Try clicking on the Add Item button to\r\n        add some items to the list. Then try changing the values in the inputs.\r\n        <pre>\r\n          <code className=\"language-jsx\">\r\n          </code>\r\n        </pre>\r\n      </Typography>\r\n    </Box>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n"],"names":["StateUpdating","id","paragraph","className"],"sourceRoot":""}
