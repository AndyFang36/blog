      <h1>what is apple</h1>
      <p>
        an apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple trees are
        cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree
        originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today.
        Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North
        America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many
        cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.
      </p>
      <p>
        apple trees are large if grown from seed. Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by
        grafting onto rootstocks, which control the size of the resulting tree. There are more than
        7,500 known cultivars of apples, resulting in a range of desired characteristics. Different
        cultivars are bred for various tastes and use, including cooking, eating raw and cider
        production. Trees and fruit are prone to a number of fungal, bacterial and pest problems,
        which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's
        genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple
        production.

      <p>
        worldwide production of apples in 2018 was 86 million tonnes, with China accounting for
        nearly half of the total.<sup><a href="e01-first-letter.html">③</a></sup>
