        This paragraph does <em>not</em> establish a containing block for any of its
        descendant elements that are absolutely positioned. Therefore, the absolutely
        positioned <b>boldface</b> element it contains will be positioned with
        respect to the initial containing block.

        Thanks to <code>position: relative</code>, this paragraph establishes a
        containing block for any of its descendant elements that are absolutely
        positioned. Since there is such an element-- <em>that is to say, <b>a
        boldfaced element that is absolutely positioned,</b> placed with respect to
        its containing block (the paragraph)</em>, it will appear within the element
        box generated by the paragraph.

        they never notice the facial color of anyone else in the room. God help you
        if you're trapped at a midwifery party when the games begin. They just keep
        topping each other with tales of pregnancies with more complications and
        bigger emergencies, as though it were the most natural thing in the world,
        until the stories involve more gore and slime than any three David Cronenberg
        movies put together, with a little bit of "Alien" thrown in for good measure.
        And then you get to the <em>really</em> icky stories.
