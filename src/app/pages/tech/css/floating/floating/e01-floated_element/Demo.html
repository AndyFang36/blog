        So we browsed the shops, buying here and there, but browsing at least every other store. The
        street vendors were less abundant, but <em>much</em> more persistent, which was sort of funny.
        Kat was fun to watch, too, as she haggled with various sellers. I don't think we paid more than
        two-thirds the original asking price on anything!
      </p>
      <p class="aside">
        Of course, we found out later just how badly we'd done. But hey, that's what tourists are for.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of our buying was done in shops on the outskirts of the market area. The main section of
        the market was actually sort of a letdown, being more expensive, more touristy, and less
        friendly, in a way. About this time I started to wear down, so we caught a taxi back to the
        New Otani.
