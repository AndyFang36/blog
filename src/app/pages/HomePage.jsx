        <Typography variant="h3" fontWeight="bold" align="center">What is a personal blog?</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1">
          A personal blog is a blog that‚Äôs run by an individual author, and they add a ‚Äúpersonal touch‚Äù to
          their content by sharing their experiences, writing in a conversational tone, and so on.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1">
          Personal blogs are NOT those blogs with a ton of guest contributors. You will NEVER find a
          ‚Äúcorporate tone of voice‚Äù on personal blogs as the author loves to share their ideas and thoughts
          with their audience in a ‚Äúfriendly writing tone‚Äù.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1">
          Many personal bloggers are blogging full-time by combining their passion such as fitness or travel
          and using passive income sources like affiliate marketing to make a living from blogging.
